### Welcome 👋

There's a [famous letter](https://www.espn.com/pdf/2016/0406/nba_hinkie_redact.pdf) writted by Samuel Hinkie. In that letter, Samuel talks about his journey serving the Sixers. Magnificent references were written but there is one that I love on Seth Klarman and his approach at Baupost Group: 

> **It isn’t the only way of thinking, but it’s how we approach it.**  

Those words describe a lot this post. The way I see structures, data analysis and problem solving are not unique but it's how I approach it. 

 *I hope you enjoy it* 
 

#### Thinking about thinking

There are different methods to attack a problem usually called mental models. This models are abstractions of how we see something. Usually start as an assumption until knowledge and experience transform them into a tool of thinking that humans have made to approach solutions. 


#### Reductionism 💡

An example could be Elon Musk and the *first principles*. 

> First Principles consist in break a whole problem into small parts. This approach helps Elon back then in the early years when he creates a cheaper and more accessible rocket compared to the Russians. First principles can be classified as a reductionist method. 

Reductionist 

I'm a big fan of reductionist thinking. We can adopt it when we are study statistical models. It is helpful to see each part of a linear regression and how [it's composed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2CQITm_eo).

*Or even for the purpose to describe three of the four fundamental forces in the universe, as well as classifying elementary particles we know today.*

#### What is the opposite way of thinking 


##### 💡 Remember 💡 




The Analysis Data Process depends on the context in which you find yourself. 
- 👉🏼 Use this process as a framework 👈🏼 
  
If you are in the stage of Analyze, you can back to the Problem Stage. In the real world it's normal to go back to the problem stage and understand that the quality of our data is not optimal. Specially when you are helping to grow a company! 


##### A holistic way to see the process

![Index](/img/data%20analysis/HD.png)


#### Step 1.- Understand the problem and ask the right questions


. 
















#### Step 2.-  Understand Data





#### Step 2.- Preprocess And Analyze Data





#### Step 3.- Model Data

#### Step 4.- Analyze Data 






#### Step 6.- Report And Communicate

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
```
```{r}
train <- read.csv("data/train.csv", header = TRUE)
test <- read.csv("data/test.csv", header = TRUE)
```

```{r}
str(train)
```

```{r}
str(test)
```
##### Drop NA values from test set
```{r}
test <- data.frame(test[1], Survived = rep("NA", nrow(test)), test[ , 2:ncol(test)])
```

##### Merge train and test for visualization and analysis

```{r}
data <- rbind(train, test)
```

##### Create file from rbind product
```{r}
write.csv(data, "./data/data.cvs", row.names = FALSE )
```

```{r}
length(data$PassengerId)
```

```{r}
length(unique(data$PassengerId))
```

```{r}
data$Survived <- as.factor(data$Survived)
table(data$Survived, dnn = "Number of Survived in Data Frame")
```

```{r}
prop.table(table(as.factor(train$Survived), dnn = "Survive and death ratio in Train Data"))
```

##### Time to change type of data

```{r}
data$Pclass <- as.factor(data$Pclass)
```


```{r}
table(data$Pclass, dnn = "Pclass values in Data")
```
