<p>There is a <a href="https://www.espn.com/pdf/2016/0406/nba_hinkie_redact.pdf">famous letter</a> by Samuel Hinkie where he talks about his journey serving the Sixers. He wrote magnificent references, but there is one that I love on Seth Klarman and his approach at Baupost Group:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>“It isn’t the only way of thinking, but it’s how we approach it.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those words te way I see structures, data analysis, and problem-solving. This is not unique, but it’s how I approach it. In the end, the knowledge I have is the result of all the interactions throughout my life.</p>

<h4 id="thinking-about-small-things">Thinking about small things</h4>

<p>There are different methods to attack a problem, usually called mental models. These models are abstractions of how we see something. Usually, start as an assumption until knowledge and experience transform them into a tool of thinking that humans have made to approach solutions.</p>

<p>An example could be Elon Musk and the <em>first-principles</em>. This mental model consists of breaking a whole problem into small parts. The first principles (and his reductionist nature) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV3sBlRgzTI">helped Elon</a> back then in the early years when he creates a cheaper and more accessible rocket.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism">Reductionism</a> is any of several related philosophical ideas regarding the associations between phenomena, which can be described in terms of other simpler or more fundamental phenomena. It is also described as an intellectual and philosophical position that interprets a complex system as the sum of its parts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In simple words, reductionism maintain that whole (phenomenon) can be understood from the essence of his parts and the relations among them, even if those parts are different from each other.</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of reductionism. This way of thinking can be adopted when we are studying statistical models. It is helpful to see each part of a model and how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2CQITm_eo">it’s composed</a>.</p>

<p>Or even for the purpose to describe three of the four fundamental forces in the universe. <a href="https://cosmicescapes.com/the-standard-model-of-particle-physics/">The Standard Model Of Particle Physics.</a></p>

<h4 id="thinking-about-big-things">Thinking about big things</h4>

<p>It’s time to see the whole picture. We know that reductionism breaks phenomenons into small things and understands the whole by seen the interaction among them.</p>

<p>What about Holism?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-11636-1_5">Holism</a> maintain the contrary view, that the parts of a whole are internally related, so that the essence of each is partially constituted by the properties of all the others and of the whole. Hence, the whole cannot be understood from its parts and their relations to each other alone; and conversely, the parts cannot be fully understood apart from the whole.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Business understand this way of thinking. Specially disciplines like growth and product who needs to understand the whole picture.</p>

<p>This is a great example created by <a href="https://www.reforge.com/blog/growth-loops">Reforge</a></p>

<p><img src="/img/data%20analysis/Loops.png" alt="Loops" /></p>

<h4 id="the-union-between-small-and-big-things">The union between small and big things</h4>

<p>I don’t believe that Reductionism and Holism are not mutually exclusive. I think they are great frameworks of thinking, and without fanaticism, we can use them powerfully.</p>

<p>There’s a way named systematic thinking. This thinking creates a balance between Reductionism and Holism.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.intelligentspeculation.com/blog/systems-thinking">By thinking about the overall system</a> at once and how everything fits together, you are more likely to account for nuanced interactions between components that could lead to negative, unintended consequences if left unaccounted for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can say that systemic thinking allows us to unite the two ways of looking at a phenomenon. With systems thinking, we can deconstruct a complex Phenomenon while understanding his context.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can the product team invest in new improvements, or is it better to concentrate on closing deals?</li>
  <li>Can the engineering team scale up at the same time as user acquisition and retention?</li>
</ul>

<p>We can stop seeing a problem as monolithic. Instead, we can treat a problem as a series of actions and consequences that are interrelated. With this thinking, we can visualize patterns to attack a problem.</p>

<hr />

<p>At this point you may be wondering how all this is related to data analysis?</p>

<p>One step for any thinking framework is always analysis (vice versa), and this analysis always contains data. It doesn’t matter if it is critical thinking, design thinking, problem-solving, logical thinking, etc. Everything leads to analysis, reductionism, holism, and systems thinking.</p>

<p>Let me show you what I mean with a real example using the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic">classical titanic dataset.</a></p>

<p>As we see, the first step is understand what you want to accomplish. This is really hard. REALLY hard.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What exactly is the question?</li>
  <li>What motivates our efforts?</li>
</ul>

<p>In my last big project, I work with 4 big companies.</p>
